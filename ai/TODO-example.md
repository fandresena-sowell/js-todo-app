# Slime Ecosystem Simulator - Todo List

## Setup and Boilerplate
- [x] Initialize project with Excalibur.js and Vite
- [x] Create a basic game structure
- [x] Add Slime actor with animations and movement
- [x] Setup basic controls (arrow keys for movement, space for sprint)

## Core Slime Simulation
- [x] Implement slime DNA/genetics system (traits like color, size, speed, etc.)
- [x] Add random slime spawning mechanism
- [x] Create food resources that slimes can consume
- [ ] Implement energy system (slimes need to eat to survive)
- [ ] Add slime reproduction (when they have enough energy)
- [ ] Implement basic slime AI for seeking food

## Environment
- [ ] Create a bounded world with borders
- [ ] Add environmental features (obstacles, terrain types)
- [ ] Implement day/night cycle
- [ ] Add weather effects that influence slime behavior

## Evolution and Ecosystem
- [ ] Implement natural selection (slimes with better traits survive longer)
- [ ] Add predator/prey relationships between different slime types
- [ ] Create ecosystem balance metrics
- [ ] Implement mutations during reproduction

## UI/UX
- [ ] Add information panel showing ecosystem stats
- [ ] Create controls for simulation speed
- [ ] Add ability to select and track individual slimes
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality
- [ ] Add visualization tools for viewing evolutionary progress

## Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement different biomes with unique characteristics
- [ ] Add disease and immunity mechanics
- [ ] Create food chain and complexity visualization
- [ ] Add user intervention tools (adding food, changing environment)
- [ ] Implement emergent behavior tracking

## Performance and Optimization
- [ ] Optimize rendering for large numbers of slimes
- [ ] Implement spatial partitioning for collision detection
- [ ] Add level of detail system for distant slimes
- [ ] Optimize AI calculations for large populations

## Documentation and Polishing
- [ ] Create user guide for simulation controls
- [ ] Document the slime genetics system
- [ ] Add tooltips and helping guides
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
